# Homomorphic-Encryption-and-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning techniques are being extensively used in multiple domains to analyse the associated data and present insights to optimize performance. However, application of Machine Learning models on sensitive data-sets presents extensive risks to user-privacy owing to the high probability of compromising sensitive user data, when it is provided to the Machine Learning pipeline. To counter this threat, we propose the use of a customized Homomorphic-Encryption scheme that allows for adequate encryption of the user-data through the use of a scheme that employs Public and Private Keys. We analyze and implement a basic Fully Homomorphic Encryption model. We also apply the Homomorphic Encryption scheme on a Linear Regression model for sensitive Medical data. Thus, we observe that the encryption efficiently protects the sanctity of the input test data and corresponding result data for a Regression model. It provides immunity from both Model-Inversion and Membership-Inference attacks, for the ML model and the associated sensitive user-data.
